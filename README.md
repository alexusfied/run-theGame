# Run - A JavaScript game

This little game build in JavaScript is a nice exercise project. The goal is to avoid getting touched by the moving obstacles by using the arrow keys to move around our hero (the dot).
The code is by no means perfect, but it works and is a nice exercise. Improvements could be made in readability, performance, implementation of OOP-concepts and some other aspects. Also, choosing different level of difficulty might be added in the future.

The main purpose of this project is to practice OOP, animation and how to use JavaScript in general in order to make a site interactive.
