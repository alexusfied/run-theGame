# Run - A JavaScript game
This little game build in JavaScript is a nice exercise project. The goal is to avoid getting touched by the moving obstacles by using the arrow keys to move around our hero (the dot)
--> The game is not finished at the moment. Collision detection is still under construction. As of now, the game won't be over when the player is hit by any of the balls
